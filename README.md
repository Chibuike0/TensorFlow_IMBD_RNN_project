### IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset

IMDB dataset is a collection of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, which was used to build an RNN sentiment analysis in this project. The reviews are split evenly between positive and negative sentiments, making it a great resource for binary classification tasks. 25,000 reviews for training your model and another 25,000 for testing.

Simple binary classificationâ€”0 for negative reviews, 1 for positive.

For experimenting: different RNN models were built with different adjusts within the hidden layers or dropout etc. Addtiionally a Forward Feed Neural Network (FFNN) was used for comparative analysis.
